## Features

The reason I created this theme was for me to personalize my Discord experience, it includes this features :

* Takes advantage of the whole screen for things like parameters
* Removes the upper bar where is located the Discord logo and integrates the buttons aside the help button
* Increase the size of user profiles
* Background images of server's invite aren't cropped
* Removes Nitro and Friends tabs
* Removes gift, gif, stikers and emojis buttons from the message bar
* And a bunch of other little things

Some are configurable in the theme file.

### Other themes
Since I created this theme for my personnal use, I added complementary features for other themes :
* [RadialStatus](https://github.com/DiscordStyles/RadialStatus/) use the avatar shape parameter in avatar messages
* [HorizontalServerList](https://github.com/DiscordStyles/HorizontalServerList) adapt the server list to go along with the buttons of the window
