## Features

The reason I created this theme was for Discord to use the whole space your screen has to offer, so instead of using just a portion of it, it uses your entire screen!

It also increase the size of user profiles.

It removes the Nitro tab.

It removes the upper bar where is located the Discord logo and integrates the buttons aside the help button.

And a bunch of other little things.

### Other themes
Since I created this theme for my personnal use I added complementary features for other themes, for [RadialStatus](https://github.com/DiscordStyles/RadialStatus/) it uses the avatar shape parameter in messages and for [HorizontalServerList](https://github.com/DiscordStyles/HorizontalServerList) it adapts the server bar to go along with the buttons of the window.
