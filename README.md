## Features

The reason I created this theme was for Discord to use the whole space your screen has to offer, so instead of using just a portion of it, it uses your entire screen!

Also :
* Removes Stage Discovery and Nitro tabs
* Increase the size of user profiles
* Background images of server's invite aren't cropped
* Removes the upper bar where is located the Discord logo and integrates the buttons aside the help button.

And a bunch of other little things.

### Other themes
Since I created this theme for my personnal use I added complementary features for other themes, for [RadialStatus](https://github.com/DiscordStyles/RadialStatus/) it uses the avatar shape parameter in messages and for [HorizontalServerList](https://github.com/DiscordStyles/HorizontalServerList) it adapts the server bar to go along with the buttons of the window.
